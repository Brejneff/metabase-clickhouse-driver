# metabase-clickhouse-driver
MetaBase driver for the ClickHouse database

# History
The request for a ClickHouse MetaBase driver is formulated in [MetaBase issue #3332](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/issues/3332). This issue has received many thumbs-up reactions, and some impatient ClickHouse users started development. The MetaBase team has - understandably - decided not to bother with any driver PRs right now, but is asking driver developers to publish plug-ins.

This driver is based on the following PRs:
* [metabase#8491](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/8491)
* [metabase#8722](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/8722)
* [metabase#9469](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/9469)

The initial source base comprises major contributions from these authors (_the git log has suffered from frequent brutal rebases, please, please add yourself here, if I missed you!_):
